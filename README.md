An animated GIF for the [Adafruit Matrix Portal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4812) kit.  This is just an extension of the code by Gamblor21 found [here](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/Gamblor21/pages/circuitpython-animated-gifs-on-a-matrix-portal).  The examples file includes some of the imagemagick commands I used when preparing gifs for my project.

Place your gif files sized for your display in `/gifs/` on the circuitpython device.
